## What is CLOB?

The Central Limit Order Book (CLOB) is Polymarket's order matching system. It aggregates all buy and sell orders for each market, enabling efficient price discovery and trade execution.

## How It Works

### Order Matching

The CLOB matches buyers and sellers based on price and time priority:

1. **Price Priority:** Best prices are matched first
2. **Time Priority:** Earlier orders at the same price are filled first
3. **Continuous Trading:** Orders are matched in real-time as they arrive

### Market Structure

Each market has two order books, one for each outcome:

- **YES Order Book:** Orders to buy/sell YES shares
- **NO Order Book:** Orders to buy/sell NO shares

Prices always satisfy: YES Price + NO Price = $1.00

## Order Types

### Limit Orders

Specify the exact price and size you want to trade:

- **Buy Limit:** Maximum price you'll pay
- **Sell Limit:** Minimum price you'll accept
- **Fills:** Partial or complete based on available liquidity

**Example:**
```json
{
  "side": "BUY",
  "price": "0.65",
  "size": "100"
}
```

### Market Orders

Execute immediately at the best available price:

- **Buy Market:** Purchase at lowest ask price
- **Sell Market:** Sell at highest bid price
- **Slippage:** May execute at multiple price levels

## Order Book Structure

### Bids and Asks

- **Bids:** Buy orders (demand side)
- **Asks:** Sell orders (supply side)
- **Spread:** Difference between best bid and best ask

### Order Book Depth

The order book shows liquidity at each price level:

```
Asks (Sell Orders)
Price   Size
$0.68   150
$0.67   200
$0.66   300

Spread: $0.01

Bids (Buy Orders)
Price   Size
$0.65   250
$0.64   180
$0.63   220
```

## Key Features

### High Liquidity

The CLOB aggregates orders from all participants, creating deep liquidity pools for popular markets.

### Transparent Pricing

All orders are visible in the order book, providing complete price transparency.

### Fair Execution

Orders are matched algorithmically based on price-time priority, ensuring fair execution.

### Real-Time Updates

Order book changes are broadcast in real-time via WebSocket connections.

## API Access

## Best Practices

### For Market Makers

1. Monitor order book depth
2. Update quotes based on price changes
3. Manage inventory across YES/NO positions
4. Use WebSocket for real-time updates

### For Traders

1. Check order book before trading
2. Use limit orders for better prices
3. Be aware of slippage on large orders

### For Developers

1. Implement proper error handling
2. Cache static market data
3. Use WebSocket for live data
4. Respect rate limits

## Trading Fees

Polymarket charges **zero trading fees** on the CLOB. You only pay blockchain gas fees for on-chain operations (deposits/withdrawals).
