## Overview

Gamma Markets provide the structural layer for Polymarket's prediction markets. This includes market metadata, outcome definitions, resolution rules, and market lifecycle management.

## Market Structure

### Market Components

Each market consists of:

1. **Question:** What is being predicted
2. **Outcomes:** Possible results (typically YES/NO)
3. **Resolution Source:** How outcome is determined
4. **End Date:** When market closes for trading
5. **Resolution Date:** When outcome is finalized
6. **Metadata:** Additional information

### Market Object

```json

## Market Lifecycle

### States

Markets progress through these states:

1. **Draft:** Being created
2. **Active:** Open for trading
3. **Closed:** Trading ended, awaiting resolution
4. **Resolved:** Outcome determined
5. **Disputed:** Resolution challenged
6. **Finalized:** Payouts complete

### State Transitions

```
Draft → Active → Closed → Resolved → Finalized
                    ↓
                Disputed → Resolved → Finalized
```

## Outcome Tokens

### Token Structure

Each outcome is represented by an ERC-20 token:

```json
{
  "token_id": "0x1234...",
  "name": "Will X happen? - Yes",
  "symbol": "POLY-YES-123",
  "decimals": 6,
  "market_id": "market_id",
  "outcome": "Yes",
  "supply": "10000000000"
}
```

### Token Properties

- **Collateralized:** Each YES/NO pair backed by 1 USDC
- **Divisible:** Can be split into fractional shares
- **Tradeable:** Can be bought/sold on CLOB
- **Redeemable:** Winners redeem for 1 USDC

## Market Categories

Markets are organized into categories:

- **Politics:** Elections, legislation, appointments

async function checkMarketStatus(marketId) {
  const market = await getMarketData(marketId);

  if (market.status === 'closed') {
    console.log('Market closed, awaiting resolution');
  } else if (market.status === 'resolved') {
