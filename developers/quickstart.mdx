description: "Make your first API call to Polymarket in minutes"

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:

- Basic understanding of REST APIs
- Familiarity with JSON
- HTTP client (curl, Postman, or programming language of choice)
- USDC on Polygon (if you plan to trade)

## API Endpoint

The Polymarket CLOB API is available at:

```
https://clob.polymarket.com
```

## Your First API Call

Let's fetch market data for all active markets:

```bash
curl https://clob.polymarket.com/markets
```

This returns a list of all available markets with their metadata.

## Key Concepts

### Markets

Each market represents a question about a future event. Markets contain:

- **Market ID:** Unique identifier
- **Question:** The event being predicted
- **Outcomes:** Possible results (usually YES/NO)
- **End Date:** When the market closes
- **Resolution Source:** How the outcome is determined

### Tokens

Each outcome in a market is represented by a token:

- **Token ID:** Unique identifier for the outcome
- **Price:** Current trading price ($0.00 - $1.00)
- **Volume:** Total trading volume

### Orders

Orders represent buy or sell intentions:

- **Limit Orders:** Specify exact price and size
- **Market Orders:** Execute at current market price
- **Order Book:** Collection of all outstanding orders

## Common API Operations

### Get Market Information

```bash
# Get all markets
curl https://clob.polymarket.com/markets

# Get specific market
curl https://clob.polymarket.com/markets/{market_id}
```

### Get Order Book

```bash
curl https://clob.polymarket.com/book?token_id={token_id}
```

### Get Market Prices

```bash
curl https://clob.polymarket.com/prices?market_id={market_id}
```

### Get Price History

```bash
curl https://clob.polymarket.com/prices/history?market_id={market_id}
```

## Rate Limits

The API has rate limits to ensure fair usage:

- **Default:** 100 requests per minute
- **Authenticated:** Higher limits available
- **WebSocket:** Preferred for real-time data

If you exceed rate limits, you'll receive a 429 status code.

## Authentication

For trading operations (placing/canceling orders), you'll need to authenticate your requests:

1. Generate an API key from your account
2. Sign requests with your private key
3. Include authentication headers

See the CLOB API documentation for detailed authentication instructions.

## Best Practices

1. **Cache Responses:** Reduce API calls by caching market data
2. **Use WebSockets:** For real-time data, use WebSocket connections
3. **Handle Errors:** Implement proper error handling and retries
4. **Respect Rate Limits:** Monitor your usage and implement backoff strategies
5. **Test First:** Use test environments before going to production
