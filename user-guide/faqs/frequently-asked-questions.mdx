## How To Use Embeds

Embedding Polymarket content on your website or application is a powerful way to integrate live market data and trading functionality directly into your platform.

### Adding Market Embeds to Your Site

You can add market embeds to platforms like Substack, Medium, or any custom website. Embeds allow you to:

- Display live market prices and charts
- Show trading interfaces for specific markets
- Embed probability indicators
- Integrate prediction market data into content

### Implementation

Polymarket provides embed codes that you can paste into your website or blogging platform. The embeds are fully responsive and will automatically adapt to different screen sizes and devices.

For detailed embed code examples and implementation guides, refer to the Developer Documentation section or contact the support team for specific use cases.

## Polymarket vs. Polling

### How Prediction Markets Outperform Traditional Polling

Prediction markets like Polymarket often outperform traditional polling methods in accuracy and responsiveness. Here's why:

### The Key Difference: Financial Incentives

Traditional polls ask people their opinions without any financial stake, whereas prediction markets require participants to put real money behind their forecasts. This fundamental difference creates significantly more accurate outcomes.

**Why It Matters:**
- When people must invest financially to back their beliefs, they conduct deeper research
- Market participants are motivated to make informed, honest assessments
- Unlike polls where responses are casual opinions, traders have skin in the game
- This financial commitment filters out casual guesses and emphasizes serious analysis

### How Prediction Markets Work

On Polymarket, traders buy and sell shares tied to specific outcomes. The market price reflects the collective wisdom of all participants who've analyzed available information. This aggregation of knowledge typically produces better forecasts than surveying a sample population.

### Advantages of Prediction Markets
- Aggregates diverse information sources in real-time
- Participants have financial incentive for accuracy
- Real-time price updates reflect new information as it emerges
- Market prices represent crowdsourced probabilities backed by conviction
- Historically outperform traditional polls for political events, sports, and forecasting

### Traditional Polling Limitations
- Snapshot in time with sampling errors
- No financial incentive for accuracy
- Less frequent updates and delayed insights
- Limited to survey respondents
- Prone to response bias and unreliable methodology

## Recover Missing Deposit

If you've sent the wrong cryptocurrency to your account or deposited funds on the incorrect blockchain network (Ethereum or Polygon), Polymarket provides recovery tools to help you retrieve those funds.

### Common Deposit Issues

**Wrong Cryptocurrency Deposited:**
If you accidentally sent an unsupported token or the wrong cryptocurrency to your Polymarket address, recovery solutions are available.

**Wrong Blockchain Network:**
If you deposited funds on Ethereum instead of Polygon (or vice versa), or used another unsupported network, Polymarket has tools to help recover these assets.

### Steps to Recover Missing Deposits

1. **Check the transaction status** on the blockchain explorer (Etherscan for Ethereum, PolygonScan for Polygon)
2. **Verify the address** where you sent the funds
3. **Confirm the token and network** you used
4. **Wait for blockchain confirmation** (may take several minutes depending on network congestion)
5. **Access recovery tools** if you deposited the wrong cryptocurrency - Polymarket provides specific mechanisms to address these situations
6. **Contact support** if the issue persists after confirmations

### Getting Help

For assistance with fund recovery, reach out to the Polymarket support team with:
- Your transaction hash
- The address you used
- Details about the cryptocurrency/network used
- Your account information

The team can guide you through the recovery process and help retrieve your funds.

## Can I Sell Early?

Yes! One of the key advantages of Polymarket is the ability to exit your positions before market resolution, giving you flexibility and control over your trading strategy.

### Why Sell Early?

**Benefits of Early Exit:**
- **Lock in profits** if the price moves in your favor
- **Cut losses** if the market moves against you
- **Adjust positions** based on new information or changed circumstances
- **No need to wait** for the event to fully resolve
- **Access liquidity** at any time during the market's active period

### How It Works

Simply sell your shares on the market at the current price. The liquidity and exact price depend on:
- Supply and demand from other traders
- Overall market interest in that prediction
- The current probability reflected by the market

### Market Efficiency

Because Polymarket operates on peer-to-peer (P2P) trading without the platform acting as the house, you're trading against other participants. This means:
- You can exit whenever the market is active
- Prices are determined by other traders' willingness to buy/sell
- Greater flexibility compared to traditional betting where you're locked in until resolution

This ability to trade positions early distinguishes prediction markets from traditional betting or polling models where you must wait for the final outcome.

## Does Polymarket Have a Token?

Currently, Polymarket does not have a native platform token. Polymarket focuses on providing a decentralized prediction market platform without issuing its own cryptocurrency.

### Trading Currency

All trading on Polymarket is conducted using **USDC (USD Coin)**, a stablecoin pegged to the US dollar. USDC provides:

- **Price stability:** 1 USDC = $1 USD at all times
- **Compatibility:** Works across both Ethereum and Polygon blockchains
- **Transparency:** Fully backed and regularly audited
- **Efficiency:** Faster than traditional currencies, lower fees than alternative payment methods

### Why USDC Instead of a Platform Token?

Using USDC instead of a proprietary token offers several advantages:
- Reduces volatility for traders
- Simplifies the trading experience
- Provides a stable unit of account for prediction markets
- Enables frictionless deposits and withdrawals
- Maintains focus on the core prediction market functionality

This approach allows Polymarket to operate as a pure prediction market platform rather than managing both a trading ecosystem and a separate token economy.

## Does Polymarket have an API?

## How Do I Export My Key?

Exporting your private key allows you to back up your wallet or migrate to another application. Polymarket supports exporting your private key through Magic.Link authentication.

### Steps to Export Your Private Key

1. **Access your account settings**
   - Log into your Polymarket account
   - Navigate to account or profile settings

2. **Find security or backup options**
   - Look for "Security," "Account," or "Backup" sections
   - Some wallets place this under "Advanced" settings

3. **Initiate private key export**
   - Select the option to export or reveal your private key
   - You may be asked to confirm your identity
   - Follow any authentication prompts

4. **Securely store your key**
   - Copy your private key carefully
   - Store it in a secure location (hardware wallet, encrypted file, etc.)
   - Never share it with anyone

### Critical Security Warning

**Your private key gives complete control over your funds. Treat it with extreme caution:**

- **Never share** your private key with anyone, including Polymarket support staff
- **Never post** your private key online or in chat
- **Never enter** your private key on unsecured websites
- **Store safely** in a secure location only you can access
- **Keep backed up** in case you lose access to your device
- **Assume complete responsibility** for protecting it

### If Your Key is Compromised

If you believe your private key has been exposed:
1. Move your funds immediately to a new wallet
2. Do not delay - funds can be accessed with the private key
3. Contact support for assistance
4. Never re-use the compromised private key

Remember: Polymarket support staff will NEVER ask you for your private key. Anyone requesting it is attempting to steal your funds.

## Is My Money Safe?

Yes. Polymarket is **non-custodial**, which means you're in control of your funds. The platform prioritizes security through blockchain technology and decentralized architecture.

### How Your Money is Protected

**1. Decentralized Architecture**
- Your funds are held in smart contracts on the Polygon blockchain
- No central point of failure
- Transparent on-chain settlement

**2. Self-Custody Model**
- You maintain complete control of your private keys
- Polymarket cannot access, freeze, or seize your funds
- Your funds are truly yours alone

**3. Blockchain Transparency**
- All transactions are verifiable on the Polygon blockchain
- You can independently verify your account balance
- Complete audit trail of all trades and deposits

**4. Security Audits**
- Smart contracts undergo professional security audits
- Regular security reviews and updates
- Industry-standard practices and protocols

**5. No Counterparty Risk**
- Polymarket doesn't act as the house or counterparty
- The platform facilitates peer-to-peer trades only
- No "house risk" from platform operations

### Reducing Risk Yourself

As with all crypto platforms, you're responsible for:
- **Securing your private keys** - store them safely and never share them
- **Protecting your password** - use strong, unique passwords
- **Enabling security features** - use any 2FA or additional authentication available
- **Verifying transactions** - double-check addresses before sending funds
- **Managing seed phrases** - back up and secure your recovery phrases

### What Makes This Safe

The non-custodial model means:
- Polymarket cannot be hacked to steal your funds (your keys aren't stored there)
- The platform cannot face insolvency affecting your account
- You maintain absolute control and ownership
- All trading is transparent and verifiable on-chain

This is fundamentally different from centralized exchanges where the platform holds custody of your funds.

## Is Polymarket The House?

**No.** Polymarket is not the house. All trades happen peer-to-peer (P2P) - users trade directly with each other, not against the platform.

### The P2P Trading Model

**How It Works:**
- Polymarket provides the platform and infrastructure
- Users trade directly with other users
- Other traders are your counterparties
- Prices are determined by supply and demand between traders
- The platform facilitates trades but doesn't take positions

**What This Means:**
- Polymarket doesn't profit from your losses
- Polymarket doesn't bet against you
- Polymarket has no incentive to limit your wins
- All trades are between participants, not with the house

### Key Advantages

**No Betting Limits**
- Unlike traditional sportsbooks, there are no limits on your winnings
- Successful traders face no account restrictions
- Your wins won't be capped or limited

**No House Edge**
- There's no built-in advantage the platform maintains
- Prices reflect true supply and demand
- You're competing with other traders, not fighting a rigged system

**Fair Competition**
- Winners and losers are determined by market forces
- Information and timing skills matter
- No arbitrary decisions by the house

### Platform Revenue

Polymarket sustains itself through:
- Order matching and platform fees
- Infrastructure costs
- Not from taking the opposite side of your trades

This non-custodial, peer-to-peer model is a fundamental difference from:
- Traditional betting platforms (where the house takes a cut of every bet)
- Centralized exchanges (where the platform may have conflicting interests)
- Sportsbooks (where house limits are common)

## What is a Prediction Market?

A prediction market is a platform where people collectively forecast the future by trading shares that represent different possible outcomes of events. Market prices reflect the aggregate belief about the probability of those outcomes occurring.

### How Prediction Markets Work

**1. Market Creation**
- Markets are created for specific future events
- Events can be in politics, sports, finance, entertainment, or any domain
- Each market has defined possible outcomes

**2. Trading Mechanism**
- Participants buy and sell shares representing outcomes
- Shares are conditional tokens tied to market outcomes
- Share prices range from $0.00 to $1.00
- Each price represents a probability (e.g., $0.30 = 30% chance)

**3. Price Discovery**
- Market price = collective market estimate of probability
- Prices update in real-time based on trading activity
- New information causes price adjustments
- Supply and demand determine prices

**4. Settlement**
- Event resolves based on verified information
- Winning shares pay out $1.00
- Losing shares pay out $0.00
- Traders profit/lose based on their positions

### Real-World Example

**Market:** "Will it rain tomorrow?"
- YES shares trade at $0.30
- NO shares trade at $0.70
- This means the market believes there's a 30% chance of rain
- If it rains, YES share holders profit; NO share holders lose
- If it doesn't rain, the opposite occurs

### Why Prediction Markets Are Accurate

**1. Financial Incentives**
- Participants have skin in the game
- Wrong predictions cost real money
- Encourages honest and informed forecasts

**2. Information Aggregation**
- Combines news, analysis, and expert opinions
- Incorporates all available information
- Diverse perspectives lead to better estimates
- Crowdsourced wisdom approach

**3. Continuous Updating**
- Prices update instantly with new information
- Markets respond quickly to developments
- Real-time adjustments for changing circumstances
- More responsive than periodic polls

**4. Efficiency**
- Market mechanisms reward accurate participants
- Informed traders profit and increase their influence
- Less informed traders eventually lose capital
- Natural selection drives accuracy

### Historical Performance

Research demonstrates that prediction markets:
- **Often outperform expert predictions** on complex events
- **Beat traditional polling methods** in accuracy
- **Predict sports outcomes better** than Vegas odds
- **Forecast political elections** with high accuracy
- **Aggregate information more efficiently** than alternative methods

### Use Cases

Prediction markets like Polymarket are used to forecast:
