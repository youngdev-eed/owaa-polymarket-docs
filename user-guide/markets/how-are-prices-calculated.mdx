The prices and probabilities displayed on Polymarket are calculated as the midpoint of the bid-ask spread in the order book. This methodology ensures that prices reflect the consensus market valuation based on active trading.

## Understanding the Bid-Ask Spread

When you view a market on Polymarket, the displayed price represents the midpoint between:
- **Bid**: The highest price that buyers are willing to pay
- **Ask**: The lowest price that sellers are willing to accept

This approach provides an accurate representation of market sentiment and current valuation for prediction market shares.
