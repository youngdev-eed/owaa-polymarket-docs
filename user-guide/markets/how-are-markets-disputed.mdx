**Anyone can dispute a proposed market resolution if they feel it was proposed in error.** Once a market receives a resolution proposal, it enters a 2-hour challenge window. If no one contests the proposal during this period, the resolution becomes final and the proposer recovers their bond plus any reward.

## Disputing a Market

During the challenge phase, anyone may file a dispute on the UMA dapp by posting a challenge bond matching the proposer's amount (typically $750). This initiates a debate period lasting 24-48 hours, with voting occurring every other day and minimum discussion time guaranteed. Community members can contribute evidence and analysis in Uma Discord channels dedicated to "#evidence-rationale" and "#voting-discussion."

## Voting Process

After the debate phase concludes, UMA token holders vote in a process taking roughly 48 hours. One of four outcomes results:

### Proposer Wins

The proposer receives their bond back plus half the disputer's bond as compensation. The disputer forfeits their bond.

### Disputer Wins

The disputer recovers their bond plus half the proposer's bond as reward. The proposer loses their bond.

### Too Early

For proposals where the underlying event hasn't yet occurred (such as ongoing sports matches), the disputer recovers their bond plus half the proposer's bond. The proposer loses their bond.

### Unknown/50-50

For circumstances not fitting other categories, the market resolves to equal probabilities. The disputer recovers their bond plus half the proposer's bond. The proposer loses their bond.
