description: "Markets on Polymarket can be clarified when unforeseen circumstances require rule clarification."

Markets on Polymarket are resolved according to rules established on the market page. These rules specify:
- The resolution source
- The market end date
- How the market should resolve in various edge cases

The market title describes what the market covers, but the detailed rules define the actual resolution methodology.

## Clarifications Process

In rare situations, unforeseen circumstances may arise after market creation that require rule clarification. When this occurs, Polymarket may issue an "Additional context" update to the market rules.

Users who believe a clarification is necessary can request one in the Polymarket Discord server's **#market-review** channel. This is noted as "the best place to request a clarification."

The documentation includes examples of such clarifications from markets regarding specific events or statements that required additional context for proper resolution.
