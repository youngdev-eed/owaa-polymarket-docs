Markets on Polymarket are established by the internal markets team, incorporating feedback from both users and the broader community.

## Can I create my own market?

While direct market creation by individual users is not available, the platform actively encourages participants to propose new market ideas. When evaluating which markets to list, Polymarket considers several key factors in their selection process.

## Submit your market proposal

To maximize the likelihood of your proposal being accepted and listed, provide comprehensive details including:

- Market title and description
- The "resolution source" that will determine how the market settles
- Demonstrated interest or evidence showing there is demand for trading in that particular market

### Best channels for proposing markets:

1. **Discord**: Submit ideas in the **#market-suggestion** channel on their official Discord server
2. **Twitter/X**: Tag @polymarket with your proposal
