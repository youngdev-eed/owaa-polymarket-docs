Markets on Polymarket become finalized once their outcomes become clear. The resolution process follows pre-defined rules specific to each market, which traders can find in the order book section.

## Resolution Outcomes

- Winning shareholders receive $1 per share
- Losing shares become worthless
- Trading ceases immediately upon resolution
- Resolution requires a proposed outcome backed by a USDC.e bond

## To Propose a Market Resolution

The process begins with a proposer submitting an outcome and depositing a $750 bond. If the proposal is validated as accurate, the proposer recovers the bond plus receives a reward. If unsuccessful or proposed too early, the full bond is forfeited.

Following submission, UMA reviews the transaction for correctness. Approval returns the bond plus reward to the proposer's wallet.

## To Dispute a Proposed Resolution

Once a market enters resolution proposal, there's a 2-hour challenge period. During this window, disagreeing parties can dispute the proposed outcome through UMA's dispute resolution mechanism, detailed in related documentation.
