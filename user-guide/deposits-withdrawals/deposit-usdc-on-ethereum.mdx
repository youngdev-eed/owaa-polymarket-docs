## Overview

Depositing USDC on the Ethereum network to Polymarket will automatically bridge your funds to the Polygon network. This is a convenient way to deposit if you already have USDC on Ethereum.

## How It Works

When you send USDC from Ethereum to your Polymarket deposit address:
1. The funds are received on the Ethereum network
2. They are automatically bridged to the Polygon network
3. Your Polymarket account is credited with the bridged USDC

## Related Deposit Methods

Polymarket provides several ways to fund your account:
- Transferring crypto directly from any blockchain
- Using Coinbase integration
- Card-based deposits via MoonPay
- Cross-chain transfers for larger amounts

## Video Guide

A video demonstration showing the deposit process is available on our documentation. It walks through the complete process step-by-step.
