## USDC.e Conversion

When withdrawing USDC.e (bridged USDC), the system automatically exchanges it through a Uniswap v3 pool for native USDC. This conversion maintains less than 10 basis points difference from the market rate.

## Important Considerations

### Liquidity Issues

The Uniswap v3 pool used for USDC.e conversion may be exhausted for extremely large withdrawals. If you experience difficulties with a large withdrawal, consider:

1. **Breaking Into Smaller Amounts** - Withdraw your funds in multiple smaller transactions to avoid exhausting the liquidity pool
2. **Waiting for Pool Rebalancing** - Pools rebalance over time as trading activity resumes
3. **Withdrawing USDC.e Directly** - You can bypass the Uniswap conversion by withdrawing USDC.e directly

### USDC.e Considerations

If you choose to withdraw USDC.e directly:
- Some exchanges no longer accept USDC.e deposits
- Make sure your destination wallet or exchange supports USDC.e before withdrawal
- Native USDC is generally preferred by most exchanges

## Best Practices

- For large withdrawals, split them into multiple transactions
- Verify that your destination wallet or exchange accepts the token type you're withdrawing
- Allow time for pool rebalancing if you encounter liquidity issues
