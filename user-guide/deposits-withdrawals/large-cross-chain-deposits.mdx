## Overview

For deposits exceeding $50,000, the documentation recommends using bridge services to minimize fees and slippage.

## Recommended Bridge Services

Three bridge options are suggested for large cross-chain deposits:

### DeBridge
- Connects Ethereum to Polygon with native USDC support
- Optimized for large transfers

### Across
- General-purpose cross-chain bridge
- Reliable option for multiple blockchain pairs

### Portal
- Multi-chain bridging solution
- Supports various token types

## Important Requirements

When bridging large deposits, ensure funds are sent to your **Polymarket USDC (Polygon) deposit address** located in your wallet settings.

Be mindful of potential slippage during the transaction and account for it in your deposit amount.

## Token Types

You can deposit either:
- **Native USDC** - If you deposit native USDC, the system will prompt you to "activate funds," which automatically swaps it to USDC.e through Uniswap's lowest-fee pool, keeping slippage under 10 basis points
- **USDC.e** - Bridged USDC that can be deposited directly

## Important Disclaimer

**Polymarket is not affiliated with, responsible for, or makes any guarantees regarding any third-party bridge.** Users should review each bridge's terms and conditions before proceeding with their deposit.
