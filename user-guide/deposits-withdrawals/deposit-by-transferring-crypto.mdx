## Transfer Crypto Method

The "Transfer Crypto" feature is designed as a straightforward way to deposit tokens. Users can:

1. Click the Deposit button and select Transfer Crypto
2. Choose a supported token and blockchain from dropdown menus
3. Scan a QR code or copy the deposit address
4. Send crypto from their exchange or wallet to this address
5. Receive notifications as the transfer processes

### Key Requirements:
- Deposits must exceed the minimum amount or funds won't process
