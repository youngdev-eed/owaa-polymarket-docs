# What is Polymarket?

Polymarket is the world's largest prediction market platform that enables users to trade on the outcomes of future events across various topics.

## Core Function

Users can "buy and sell shares representing future event outcomes" (like "Will TikTok be banned in the U.S. this year?"). Shares are priced between $0.00 and $1.00 in USDC, with each YES/NO pair fully backed by $1.00 in collateral.

## How Prices Work

Prices directly represent probabilities. If YES shares trade at 18 cents, the market implies an 18% chance of that outcome occurring. These prices emerge from supply and demand—Polymarket doesn't set odds; traders do through their buying and selling activity.

## Key Advantages

Unlike traditional sportsbooks, you're not betting against "the house." Instead, you trade against other users. This means you can:

- Sell shares before an event concludes to lock in profits or cut losses
- Participate without risk of being banned for winning

## Market Accuracy

Research indicates prediction markets often outperform expert predictions and polls because traders aggregate news, data, and expert opinions into real-time probabilities. This economic incentive structure encourages knowledgeable participants to trade, continuously refining market accuracy.
