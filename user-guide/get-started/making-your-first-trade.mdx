# Making Your First Trade

Once you've signed up and deposited funds, you're ready to make your first trade on Polymarket. Here's how it works.

## Basic Trading Concept

On Polymarket, you can buy and sell shares representing future event outcomes, such as "Will TikTok be banned in the U.S. this year?" Shares are priced between $0.00 and $1.00 in USDC, with each YES/NO pair fully backed by $1.00 in collateral.

## Understanding Prices

Prices on Polymarket directly represent probabilities:

- If YES shares trade at 18 cents, the market implies an 18% chance of that outcome occurring
- If YES shares trade at 75 cents, the market implies a 75% chance of that outcome occurring
- Prices emerge from supply and demand—Polymarket doesn't set odds; traders do through their buying and selling activity

## How to Execute a Trade

### Step 1: Select a Market

Browse the available prediction markets and choose one you're interested in. Read the market description carefully to understand the resolution criteria.

### Step 2: Analyze the Price

Look at the current market price for the YES/NO outcomes. If you believe an outcome is more likely than the current market price suggests, that's a potential trading opportunity.

### Example Trade

- Market: "Will inflation be below 3% by end of year?"
- Current YES price: 35 cents ($0.35)
- Your assessment: You believe there's a 50% chance of this happening
- Action: Buy YES shares at $0.35, betting the market is underpricing the probability

### Step 3: Place Your Order

- Select the outcome (YES or NO)
- Enter the amount you want to invest
- Review your order
- Confirm the trade

### Step 4: Monitor Your Position

After buying shares, you can:

- Watch the market price change in real-time
- See your unrealized profit or loss
- Decide when to exit your position

## Key Trading Features

### Liquidity

You're not locked into positions—shares can be sold anytime at current market rates, allowing you to:

- Lock in gains if the market moves in your favor
- Cut losses if you change your mind
- Exit before the event resolves

### Fair Counterparties

The counterparty is always another user, not a house, so:

- There's no entity restricting profitable traders
- Your wins are not limited by house rules
- You have full control over your positions

## Risk Management

- Start small with your first trade to get comfortable with the platform
- Only invest what you can afford to lose
- Diversify across multiple markets
- Consider the time to resolution (near-term vs. long-term events)

## Resolution

When an event resolves:

- The correct outcome becomes worth $1.00
- The incorrect outcome becomes worth $0.00
- Your shares automatically settle and your balance updates

## Next Steps

After your first trade:

- Explore other prediction markets
- Develop your trading strategy
- Engage with the community
- Refine your probability assessments

- **Do your research** - The more informed you are, the better your trading decisions
- **Stay updated** - News and developments can change market probabilities
