Limit orders function as pending trades that execute only when market prices reach your specified target. For example, if you're willing to pay 72¢ maximum for Trump "Yes" shares in the 2024 Republican Nomination but current market price is 73¢, you can place a limit order at your preferred price point and wait for a seller willing to match it.

Orders can partially fill as different traders execute portions of your order incrementally.

## Managing Limit Orders

Open orders appear directly below the Order Book on market pages. Users with multiple open positions across various markets can monitor and manage them collectively through the Portfolio page's "Open orders" tab.

Sports markets have special rules: outstanding limit orders automatically cancel at official game start times, clearing the order book. Game times can shift, so monitoring orders remains important in case of schedule changes or other circumstances.

Sports markets also include a 3-second delay on placement of marketable orders.

## Canceling Limit Orders

To cancel an open order displayed below the Order Book, click the red **x** button next to it. Multiple positions can be managed via the Portfolio page's "Open orders" tab.
