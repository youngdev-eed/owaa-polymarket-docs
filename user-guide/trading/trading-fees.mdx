## Zero Trading Fees

**Polymarket does not charge any type of fee.** The platform explicitly states there are no fees for depositing or withdrawing USDC, nor are there any fees to trade shares in any market.

## Important Clarifications

While Polymarket itself charges no fees, third-party intermediaries may impose their own charges. Specifically mentioned are services like Coinbase and MoonPay, which may charge transaction fees when users utilize their deposit services.

When depositing funds or trading, be aware that:
- Polymarket charges zero fees
- External payment processors may add their own fees
- Always check the total cost when using third-party deposit methods
