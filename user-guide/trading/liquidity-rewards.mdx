Polymarket's Liquidity Rewards Program enables users to earn money by placing limit orders that maintain market activity and balance. Key features include:

- **Proximity Bonus**: Orders closer to the market's average price generate higher earnings
- **Competitive Rewards**: Earnings depend on order size and pricing relative to other participants
- **Daily Payouts**: Rewards are distributed automatically around midnight UTC with a $1 minimum threshold
- **Market Specific**: Reward amounts, maximum spreads, and minimum share requirements vary by market

## Viewing Rewards in the Order Book

On Polymarket's order book interface, users can:

- Hover over the "Rewards" text to see total available rewards per market
- Identify the **max spread** (blue highlighted lines) indicating how far limit orders can be from the midpoint
- For markets with midpoints below $0.10, orders must exist on both sides to qualify

## Earning Rewards

Active rewards are indicated by a blue highlight around the clock icon in the trading interface, signaling that placed orders are currently earning rewards.

## Payment Structure

Rewards are calculated using specific formulas documented in the Rewards Documentation section. Users can track their reward history on their portfolio page.
