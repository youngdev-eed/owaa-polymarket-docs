Polymarket offers a **4.00% annualized Holding Reward based on your total position value in certain polymarkets.** The platform plans to introduce a new reward and oracle-resolution system later, with a simple migration path for users.

## Reward Rate and Conditions

- **Current Rate:** 4.00% annually on eligible positions
- **Rate Status:** Variable and subject to change at Polymarket's discretion
- **Distribution:** Daily payouts based on hourly sampling of position values
- **Funding:** Treasury-backed rewards program
- **Limits:** Polymarket reserves the right to introduce caps on total rewards

## Total Position Value Computation

Position value is calculated using current "Yes" and "No" share holdings multiplied by their most recent mid-market prices, then summed together.

## Example Calculation

A position with 30,000 "Yes" shares at $0.53 and 10,000 "No" shares at $0.45 equals $20,400 total value, generating approximately $0.093 in hourly rewards at the 4% annual rate.

## Eligible Markets

The rewards program covers specific prediction markets, primarily focused on:
- Presidential election outcomes
- Midterm election predictions
- International political leadership transitions
- Global ceasefire predictions
