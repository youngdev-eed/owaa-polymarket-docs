The order book displays all active buy and sell orders for shares in a specific market. It serves as a tool for traders looking to execute limit orders rather than market orders.

## Viewing the Order Book

The interface shows two sides:
- **Green side**: Represents bids (highest prices buyers will pay)
- **Red side**: Shows asks (lowest prices sellers will accept)

The example uses a "Presidential Election Winner 2024" market where there's a 0.3-cent spread between the highest bid and lowest ask.

## Managing Open Orders

Traders can monitor open orders directly on market pages or view all active orders across multiple markets through the Portfolio page under the "Open orders" tab.

## Canceling Open Orders

Orders can be canceled by clicking the red "x" button next to each order listing on the market page or through the Portfolio section.

## Advanced Trading

Understanding the Order Book helps you become an advanced trader by allowing you to:
- Execute limit orders at specific price points
- Monitor liquidity in different markets
- Make informed trading decisions based on bid-ask spreads
- Plan larger trades that may impact prices
